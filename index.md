# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio — by Katrina De Vera

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a certified data analyst passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights. Below are two of my featured Power BI projects, both built using publicly available datasets.

## 📉 Telecom Churn Prediction Dashboard — Python + Power BI

This project analyzes and predicts customer churn using the **Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle**. Using **Python in Google Colab**, I built a machine learning pipeline and trained a **Random Forest model** to identify customers at risk of churn. I then visualized the prediction output in **Power BI**.

### ✅ Key Features:
- KPIs: **Total Customers**, **Predicted Churn**, **Churn Rate**
- Churn breakdown by **Internet Service** and **Contract Type**
- Lifetime value analysis:
  - Predicted churn by **customer tenure**
  - Estimated **monthly revenue at risk**
  - **Churn probability scatterplot** (Monthly Charges vs Tenure)
- Filterable **Customer-Level Appendix**:
  - Churn risk score and predicted outcome

**🔧 Tools:** Python (Google Colab) | scikit-learn | pandas | Power BI | DAX

## 🪨 WA Mining Tenement Dashboard — Power BI Project

This project explores publicly available mining tenement data from **Western Australia**, sourced from the **WA Government website**. Using **Power BI**, I cleaned and transformed the dataset, created dynamic visuals, and built a dashboard to track trends by **tenement type**, **status**, **area**, and **holding entities**.

### ✅ Key Features:
- Slicers for **Tenement Type** and **Status**
- Calculated columns for **date parsing** and **unit conversion**
- Responsive visuals showing:
  - Area distribution by tenement type
  - Status change trends over time
  - Major stakeholders and land area held

**🔧 Tools:** Power BI Desktop | Data Cleaning | DAX | Visual Design
